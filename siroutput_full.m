%% This function takes three inputs
% x - a set of parameters
% t - the number of time-steps you wish to simulate

function f = siroutput_full(x,t)

% Here is a suggested framework for x.  However, you are free to deviate
% from this if you wish.

% set up transmission constants
k_infections = x(1);
k_fatality = x(2);
k_recover = x(3);

%k_recover_toS = x(4);


% set up initial conditions
ic_susc = x(4);
ic_inf = x(5);
ic_rec = x(6);
ic_fatality = x(7);

% Set up SIRD within-population transmission matrix

% A = [(1-k_infections)   k_recover_toS           0 0; 
%         k_infections        (1-k_recover_toS-k_recover-k_fatality)           0 0;
%         0                   k_recover   1 0;
%         0                   k_fatality   0 1];

A= [ (1-k_infections) 0 0 0; 
    k_infections (1-k_recover-k_fatality) 0 0;
    0 k_recover 1 0;
    0 k_fatality 0 1;];


% The next line creates a zero vector that will be used a few steps.
B = zeros(4,1);

% Set up the vector of initial conditions
x0 = [ic_susc, ic_inf, ic_rec, ic_fatality];

% Here is a compact way to simulate a linear dynamical system.
% Type 'help ss' and 'help lsim' to learn about how these functions work!!
sys_sir_base = ss(A,B,eye(4),zeros(4,1),1)
y = lsim(sys_sir_base,zeros(t,1),linspace(0,t-1,t),x0);

% return the output of the simulation
f = y;
